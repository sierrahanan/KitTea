    <h2 style="text-align: center">Adoptable Cats</h2>
    <p>The cats shown below are all currently adoptable, but their status can change quickly from "single and looking" to "in a serious relationship."</p><br>
    <p>Feel free to email <strong>support@kitteasf.com</strong> or call us at <strong>(415) 325-5510</strong> to confirm a certain kitten is still available for adoption. You MUST meet the cat(s) in person before being considered as their forever home. By booking a reservation in our cat lounge, you will get to know the cat/kitten before making any forever decisions, which will overall benefit both you and the cat(s) you are considering to adopt. </p>
        <h3>Steps to Adopt:</h3>
        <br>
        <ol class="adoptsteps"><li>Meet the cat(s)/kitten(s) in our cat lounge.</li>
            <li>Email <strong>support@kitteasf.com</strong> or speak to your host at the end of your visit to request an application.</li>
            <li>Fill out the application in full and send back to <strong>support@kitteasf.com</strong> to be considered. We will get back to you within 48 hours (unless the application was sent over the weekend, as this may take a bit longer to receive a reply). </li>
        <li>If your application is approved, you will receive an email from us with the good news! From there, we will have you pay via credit card through a secured payment link and have you sign our adoption agreements. </li>
        <li>You choose the day and time during KitTea business hours to pick-up and take home your new best fur friend (BFF).</li></ol>

            None
            <h4>Purrsonality Traits:</h4>
            Blankie came to us nameless, and was instead named after his affinity for blankets! He is a very cuddly and friendly cat, and very patient with children. He is still leaning to socialize with other cats. 
            <h4>Past:</h4> 
            Not much is known about Blankie's past, but he was brought to KitTea to help him learn to socialize with other cats. 
            <h4>Fun Fact: </h4>
            Blankie's blanket has been nicknamed "Blankie Jr." by staff. 
            <h4>Notes:</h4>
            Blankie prefers to be inside, but can be an outside cat as well. We do not reccomend bringing Blankie into a home with another cat.

    <h2 style="text-align: center">Purrmanent Residents</h2>
    <p>At KitTea, we care for rescue cats of all ages and backgrounds. Many of the cats you'll meet during your visit are purrmanent residents, which means they've hit the kitty jackpot and get to be spoiled and pampered by our caring staff for basically the rest of their nine lives. In turn, our resident cats help mentor and acclimate the many new adoptable kitties that come in, and entertain and socialize with our guests and visitors. These cats are not currently available for adoption, however, we always want to be sure the cats we keep are living their best and happiest lives, so in special cases, we may reach out and adopt out residents if we truly believe it is what is best for them.</p>

            <h4>Sibling:</h4>
            Ginny
            <h4>Purrsonality Traits:</h4>
            Sweet as pie, cuddly, a ham, wants to move to the Bahamas 
            <h4>Hobbies:</h4> 
            Food, racing mindlessly on the cat wheel, laying on backs and acting as a 14-pound scarf... and food 
            <h4>Bio: </h4>
            Ron is quite the purrsonality. A simple man of the world, he just wants everyone to get along and have a good time. He becomes fast friends with every human and cat he meets, and is always down for a good chin scratch or grooming session with his ginger sister, Ginny. 
            <h4>Fun Fact: </h4>
            Ron studied at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with his best friend, Harry Paw-ter, and his pet rat Scabbers.
            <h4>His Past: </h4>
            We don't have any clear facts about Ron and his sister Ginny's past, but we do know they were once part of a feral cat colony. Perhaps he lived in Northbeach Commune with the beat poets?</div></div>

            Ron 
            <h4>Purrsonality Traits: </h4>
            Sweet, chatty, athletic, loving, shoulder jumper, escape artist 
            Hobbies: 
            Napping, listening to NPR, staying up-to-date on purrent events and making sure all her fellow felines are caught up as well 
            <h4>Bio: </h4>
            Ginny is a rare kitty, as only around 18% of orange tabbies are ladies! She's a real gem to her best friend and laid-back brother Ron â€” you can frequently find them snuggling when they think no one is looking. 
            <h4>Fun Fact: </h4>
            Ginny is actually a lioness in disguise. Watch out for her ferocious love bites â€” sometimes she forgets her own strength! 
            <h4>Her Past:</h4> 
            Not much is known about Ginny and Ron's past lives, although we do know they were part of a feral colony before arriving at the shelter. This is why her right ear is clipped; it allowed rescuers to know she had already been captured, spayed, and released back to her outdoor home.</div></div>

            Hobbies: Hunting, tricks for treats, watching mewvies with his fur-riends, running across the Golden Gate Wheel, styling his tail into an intimidating punk-style scorpion tail, gently nibbling on a curious finger or two
            <h4>Bio: </h4>
            Burger is a handsome gentleman in his tuxedo. He's energetic, loves to zoomaround, and is always down to play with any fellow cat. In his meowr mellow moments, he adores receiving belly rubs while reclining in one of his favorite nap spots. 
            <h4>Fun Fact: </h4>
            Burger speaks three languages â€” Calico, Tabby, and Gaelic. 
            <h4>His Past: </h4>
            It's a mystery. How did such an all-around good guy end up in the city shelter system? Tuxedos are some of the least adopted cats in San Francisco, so we're happy to keep his dapper self safe and happy here at KitTea! </div></div>
